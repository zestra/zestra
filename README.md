# Hello World!
 - Hi, I’m Zestra and I am 12 years old. (in a month, 13 years old)
 - I’m interested in Math, Python, and Science.
 - I am currently studying a book on pygame, because I have just come to realize that the way people normally use pygame is way different from how I use it, indicating I am possibly using an outdated version and certainly I have not seen the power of pygame.
 
# Programs you can check out!
These are some top projects I was working on:
 - [Zestras-Gravity-Simulation](https://github.com/zestra/Zestras-Gravity-Simulation),
 - [Zestras-Platformer-Game](https://github.com/zestra/Zestras-Platformer-Game),
 - [Zestras-Game-of-Life](https://github.com/zestra/Zestras-Game-of-Life),
 - and [Zestras-TicTacToe](https://github.com/zestra/Zestras-TicTacToe).
